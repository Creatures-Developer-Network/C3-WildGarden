# C3-WildGarden
C3 WildGarden, formerly known as C3Wishes, is a project to convert all [Creatures 3 plants and animals](https://creatures.wiki/Category:C3_Official_Ecology) to the [Garden Box](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8GlvEesCyc) format.

These are subject to discussion and change, but the guidelines initially laid out **eight years ago** were as follows:

* All critters and bugs should be edible/pushable/pullable/hitable. All seeds/detritus should be edible. Generally, the more ways a creature can interact with an agent, the better.
* Critters that aren’t logically edible (sorry, I just can’t really imagine a norn stuffing a grazer in its mouth) should be reclassified as inedible beasts, toys, or something else.
* No plants or animals should require certain CA levels to function (light, soil nutrients, etc). Due to the generally unreliable nature of CAs, and the fact that several popular metarooms don't properly utilize them, I've decided that this would be best to ensure that these agents won't be unusable in these areas.
* All plants and animals that reproduce should have checks in place to avoid overpopulation.
* Edible animals (and seeds for reproducing plants) should have some sort of defense mechanism that kicks in when the population is low to help keep creatures from eating them into extinction (fleeing from creatures, seeds germinating faster/plants producing more seeds, turning invisible, etc). This shouldn't be foolproof, 
* Animals/Plants that must consume a food source should ideally have that source specified by genus, not species, for sake of ecological flexibility (Example being to allow the gnarlers to gain nutrients from all toys).
* While not exactly a hard standard, I would like to add some sort of special touch/personal flair to as many of these conversions as possible. For example, I think I would like to make the snail, when it dies, leave behind its shell as a toy for creatures, or give more animals and plants the ability to color mutate. I have a cute idea for allowing some critters, when pushed by creatures, to potentially get attached to them and follow them around, but I dunno how painful that would be to implement.

## Status
Currently all the cosfiles have been given icons, GB install scripts, and [CAOS2PRAY](https://creatures.wiki/CAOS2PRAY) headers. If you drag and drop them into monk, they should flawlessly compile. Some of the files were modified to meet some of the standards already but I have no idea which ones or how much.

(Once we know the status of each plant/critter, they will be listed here).

## Other Notes 

Multiple versions of the same plant/critter are absolutely encouraged, but try to take the opportunity to make the most underappreciated species shine!
